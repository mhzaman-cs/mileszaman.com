								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Waterloo" /></span>
								<p>My full name is Miles Zaman and I have been coding since I was 13. My passion for programming brought me to the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am working towards my BCS with a minor in statistics. I am interested specifically in FinTech, Software Engineering, and Data Science.</p>
								<p>I continue to develop my skills through online coursework, side projects, datathons, and hackathons. To see my projects, check out my GitHub profile. I am specifically looking for opportunities related to Software Engineering and Quantitative Research; however, I am willing to work flexibly in a different position. I value hard work, equality, and honesty. I like keeping up with the latest news in the world of technology and spending time with family. In the coming years, I hope to develop both as a person and as a working professional.</p>

									<h3>Forex</h3>
									<p>Currency conversion fees are usually considered to be unavoidable. But due to the amount of money exchanged globally between different currencies, traders could easily exchange the money directly between themselves, thus avoiding the conversion fees. This website is where people would post what currencies they have and which ones they desire. Once a match is found they meet up and trade.

									<h3>Citadel DataOpen Report</h3>

									<p>The East-Coast Dataopen hosted by Citadel and Correlation One is an invite-only Datathon featuring university students across the east coast. The event started on the 21st of March and ended on the 28th, lasting about a whole week. I was in a team of two where we analyzed the non-conventional indicators and instigators of traffic. We posed the following question: "How would investments in businesses and education affect traffic and road safety in major American cities?" In this report, we analyzed datasets and later created recommendations for which non-conventional areas municipal governments should invest in to reduce traffic congestion. The three cities of focus were New York, NY, Austin, TX, and Washington, DC. We analyzed publicly available data on 311 calls, building permits, business licenses, population education level, and traffic congestion statistics. The report could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/Citadel-Datathon">https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/Citadel-Datathon</a></p>

									<h3>OpenCare</h3>
									<p>In many parts of the world, healthcare inaccessibility is a significant problem, especially for marginalized communities such as low-income individuals, ethnic minorities, and those living in rural areas.
										
										This app allows for accessible healthcare based on an online Q&A for medical advice and is a valuable tool for people who have limited access to healthcare services. This app could provide users with a platform to ask medical questions and receive answers from qualified healthcare professionals.

										The app has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and find the information they need. To use the app, users input their medical questions, and the app would match them with qualified healthcare professionals who are best equipped to provide an accurate answer. The healthcare professionals could include doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.
										
										The Q&A feature could also include a search function that allows users to look up previously asked questions and answers. This could be particularly helpful for people who have common medical conditions and want to learn more about managing their symptoms.
										
										In addition to the Q&A feature, this app also has an upvote and downvote feature allowing expert professionals to be able to critique others' opinions allowing for a more targeted response to ensure the best type of care possible is provided to the patient. This app could help bridge the gap between patients and medical professionals and provide users with the information they need to manage their health. The report could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/OpenCare">https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/OpenCare</a></p>

									<h3>Employee Manager</h3>
									<p>Created a full-stack CRUD application that enables managers to store, view, and edit information about employees. Utilized Spring Boot in Java to handle back-end logic and stored the data in a MySQL database. Developed front-end control panel with Angular in TypeScript integrated with BootStrap for UI enhancement. Created a REST API through a REST controller which uses HTTP requests to access data from the server. Utilized Spring Data JPA to effectively develop the persistence layer to communicate with the MySQL database.

									<h3>Website Generator</h3>
									<p>This project would produce frontend webpages based on a series of questions and would then return static pages as code in the form of zip files. This would allow for flexibility while offering professional websites for users to utilize. The code could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/WebsiteGen">https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/WebsiteGen</a></p>

									<h3>Old Website</h3>
									<p>My old personal website which I had made over the summer. It was a one-page static website that featured my experiences and achievement much like this one does, however, it had a completely different UX/UI design. The code for the project could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/Front-End-Personal-Site">https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/Front-End-Personal-Site</a></p>

									<h3>Simon Game</h3>
									<p>The Simon game is an online version of the board game Simon. The board is the screen and the 4 colors correspond to the 4 colors in Simon. The objective of this game is to remember the chain of colors that were presented by the game and to input them every time the level changes.

									<h3>Drum Kit</h3>
									<p>Drum kit is an online virtual mimic of a drum set, with different keys corresponding to different types of drums. The buttons may also be clicked using the mouse pad, however, using the keyboard offers a more realistic experience. The code could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/Drum-Kit">https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/Drum-Kit</a></p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3>Dice Game</h3>
									<p>The dice challenge was one of the first challenges that I had done. The objective was to use basic javascript to create an online simulation of rolling a die. A single die represents each player, the winner of the game would be the one that rolls the higher number. Refreshing the page would roll the dice again while informing the players of who had won. The code for the project could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/Dicee_Challenge">https://github.com/mhzaman-cs/Dicee_Challenge</a></p>

									<h3>TinDog</h3>
									<p>TinDog is a remix of tinder but for dogs. This website uses Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to create a single-page static website. The written content of this webpage was provided by a course on Udemy and the challenge was to
										recreate a webpage based on a pdf document that was provided. I have added my spin to the website to make its UI/UX design more pleasant. The website could be seen on the following webpage: <a href="https://mhzaman-cs.github.io/TinDog/">https://mhzaman-cs.github.io/TinDog/</a>.

								<p>I am actively looking for internship opportunities over the school year. I am interested specifically in Product Management, FinTech, Quantitative Research, Software Engineering, and Data Science. I continue to develop these skills through online coursework, side projects, and hackathons (see GitHub for more information). Although internships specifically related to computer science and statistics interest me I am willing to work flexibly in a different position. Besides internships, I am also open to full-time and part-time employment, freelance opportunities, tutoring, volunteer work, working together in hackathons, etc.</p>
